    <h2>what is Kesra</h2>
    <p>Kesra is one of the many types of breads in Algeria, North Africa but definitely most popular, eaten daily with savoury, sweet dishes or even on its own.</p>
    <p>
        Made from semolina, yeast, olive oil, water and cooked on a round cast iron pan over a stove. The bread is quite thin which helps make it crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside. We love to enjoy it while it’s still warm with a cup of coffee or tea.

        <li>
            <p>In a large bowl place semolina, baking powder, yeast, salt, sugar, and oil. Mix with your hands, start adding water gradually and keep kneading the bread until all ingredients become one. Place the dough on the working space and kneed more until it starts to stretch but not pulling apart (add more water if necessary). Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and shape them into balls. Place back in a bowl, cover with a tea towel and rest for 10</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Place the flat pan on high heat and let it warm up. Meanwhile, take one of the dough balls on to the counter (greased with a bit of olive oil). Press the dough with your hand to create an even circle. With a fork make holes all over the bread.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Turn the heat under the pan to medium. Place the bread into the pan with the fork holes facing down. Using your fork again make holes on the plain side. Let it cook for 4-5 min on each side moving it around the pan to cook it evenly.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>    Continue with the rest of the dough until all bread is done. Enjoy while it’s still warm with a cup of coffee or tea. Store in a plastic bag for up to 2 days.
